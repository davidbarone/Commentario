The CommentarioServer provides the main functionality for documenting .NET assemblies.

<p>
Documentation comes from 2 aspects:
<ul>
    <li>Reflecting over the assembly metadata</li>
    <li>Additional descriptive information provided by the comments xml file</li>
</ul>

CommentarioServer merges the 2 sources of information to provide a fully documented picture of an assembly.
